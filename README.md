General geographic location (e.g., country or city, but not your specific address)

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

To Manage the Waitlist: We use your email address solely to:
Add you to the waitlist for YourNest.
Notify you when YourNest becomes available or when there are significant updates regarding the launch.
Communicate essential information related to the waitlist itself.
To Improve Our Site: We use anonymous analytical data to:
Understand usage patterns and trends.
Improve the functionality, design, and user experience of our Site.
Monitor the performance and security of our Site.

## 3. How We Collect Information

Email Addresses: Collected directly from you via the waitlist sign-up form on our Site.
Anonymous Analytics: Collected automatically through standard web server logs or potentially through third-party analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible Analytics) that anonymize the data they collect. These services may use cookies or similar technologies, but the data collected is aggregated and non-personally identifiable.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information (your email address) to third parties.

Waitlist Emails: We will not share your email address with any third party, except potentially with essential service providers who help us manage our email communications (e.g., an email service provider), and only under strict confidentiality agreements where they are prohibited from using your email for any other purpose.
Anonymous Analytics: We may share aggregated, anonymous analytical data with third-party service providers for analysis purposes, but this data does not include any personally identifiable information.
We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, or protect the personal safety of users or the public.   

## 5. Data Security

We implement reasonable administrative and technical measures to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. While we strive to protect your email address, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.   

## 6. Data Retention

Email Addresses: We will retain your email address for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose of the waitlist (i.e., until YourNest is launched and initial notifications are sent) or until you request removal from the waitlist, whichever comes first.
Anonymous Analytics: We may retain aggregated, anonymous analytical data indefinitely or for as long as needed for analytical purposes.

## 7. Your Choices and Rights

Waitlist Removal: You can request to be removed from our waitlist at any time by contacting us directly by email at juliuslinus1@gmail.com, upon your request, we will delete your email address from our active waitlist records.
Analytics Opt-Out: Many web browsers allow you to control cookies or tracking technologies. You may also be able to opt-out directly from some third-party analytics providers (check their respective privacy policies).
Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), you may have additional rights regarding your personal data, such as the right to access or correct the information we hold about you (in this case, your email address). Please contact us if you wish to exercise these rights.

## 8. Children's Privacy

Our Site and waitlist are not intended for children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold if applicable in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.   

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
